# TriangleChallenge-Tradeshift
 This is the triangle challenge using Tradeshift UI

Task:
Write a program that will determine the type of a triangle. It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

Solution:
- The main idea is to first validate the inputs.Next to validate if the inputs form a triangle and finally validate the type of the triangle.
- Use the triangleapp folder to view the solution.
- Using the Tradeshift UI module, I have created a UI to accept three numbers and also display the result accordingly.
- I have used Express framework with mocha testing framework for the solution.
- The UI components were clearly visible only only on the localhost hence use node app.js file to build the localhost and also execute the project.
- The main code is present in the public folder.The index.html takes care of the frontend and processTriangle.js acts as a backend and also helps to render UI components.
- In order to run the test cases use the command npm test.

Commands:
- To execute the project use:
    node app.js
- To execute the test cases use:
    npm test
